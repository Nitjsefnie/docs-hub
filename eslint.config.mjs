// ESLint flat config for the SPA in public/.
//
// This does NOT introduce a build step -- the invariant in CONTRIBUTING.md
// still holds. public/*.js is served to the browser byte-for-byte; eslint is
// a CI gate that reads those files and emits nothing. package.json exists
// only to pin the linter and let Dependabot bump it.
//
// Rules are the recommended set (real defects: undeclared identifiers, unused
// bindings, unreachable code, duplicate keys) plus four that catch the
// mistakes this particular file is exposed to: it is one 680-line script with
// no modules, so a stray `var` or an accidental `==` is genuinely hard to see.
// Style opinions -- quotes, semicolons, indentation -- are deliberately absent.
