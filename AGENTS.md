# docs-hub

`docs.nitjsefni.eu` — a password-protected, versioned HTML-artifact hub.
Fleet agents publish HTML documents (analyses, plans, reports, reviews);
a human reads them in a browser. Re-publishing a slug keeps prior
versions browsable.

## Status

Built and deployed — the server is live at `https://docs.nitjsefni.eu`.

- Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-21-docs-hub-design.md`
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-21-docs-hub.md` — 13 TDD tasks

Build the project by executing the plan task-by-task (superpowers
`subagent-driven-development` or `executing-plans`).

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `backend/` | FastAPI app — db, schema, storage, auth, session, docs_repo, login, api, views, app |
| `docs_hub_cli/` | the agent-facing client CLI, shipped as the `docs-hub-cli` wheel |
| `store/` | HTML blobs on disk, one file per version (git-ignored runtime data) |
| `tests/` | pytest suite |
| `deploy/` | systemd unit + nginx vhost |
| `docs/superpowers/` | spec + plan |

The agent-facing **CLI lives here**, in `docs_hub_cli/` — client and server
are one contract, so a change to an endpoint on one side is caught by the
same test run as the other. It builds into the `docs-hub-cli` wheel
(`pyproject.toml`), which `tag.yml` and `release.yml` publish with a
`SHA256SUMS` file on every `__version__` bump. The fleet setup bundle
installs that wheel and keeps a thin wrapper at
`~/.agent-bundle/scripts/docs_hub.py`, so the documented absolute-path
invocation keeps working unchanged.

## Architecture

- Python + FastAPI + uvicorn; psycopg3 against Postgres.
- Metadata + the version index in the local `docs` database; HTML blobs
  on local disk under `store/`.
- Human auth: user ID + password verified against the shared `authdb`
  Postgres `users` table (same credentials as the other `*.nitjsefni.eu`
  services), then an HMAC session cookie.
- Agent auth: a shared API key (`DOCS_HUB_API_KEY`, from the environment).
- Public docs: a sticky per-slug `public` flag on the `docs` row (default
  false, survives re-publishes). When set, the hash-less `/d/<slug>` latest
  route serves to anyone without auth — that is the ONLY anonymous surface.
  `/d/<slug>/v<n>`, `/api/*` and the SPA shell stay auth-gated. Toggle via
  `POST /api/doc/<slug>/public` (auth required) or the SPA doc-view button.
  `db.migrate()` applies the idempotent `ALTER TABLE` at startup.
- Served on local port 8084, behind nginx, Cloudflare-proxied.

## Development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/pytest -v
```

Tests build an isolated `docs_test` database from `backend/schema.sql`
and a temp blob store — see `tests/conftest.py`. No live network.

CI runs seven gates on every push — `tests` (the suite against Postgres
16 and 17, plus a 90% coverage floor), `lint` (pycodestyle, pylint),
`types` (pyright over `backend/`), `eslint` (over `public/`), `audit`
(pip-audit, npm audit), `codeql`, and `actionlint` (actionlint + zizmor
over the workflows). All of them are runnable locally; the table in
CONTRIBUTING.md gives the exact command for each. Run the ones your
change touches before pushing rather than using CI as the first check.

Two more workflows are the release chain rather than gates: `tag` watches
`docs_hub_cli/__init__.py` on `master`, waits for every other check on the
commit, pushes `v<version>` and then dispatches `release`, which rebuilds,
re-runs the suite and publishes the wheel plus `SHA256SUMS`. The dispatch is
load-bearing — a tag pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN` triggers no workflow at all.

## Conventions

- TDD: write the failing test first, then the minimal implementation.
- Small, focused files — one clear responsibility each.
- Every commit carries a `Co-Authored-By` trailer for the model/agent
  that authored it.
